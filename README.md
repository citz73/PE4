# PE4
Tic Tac Toe program
Person 1: Chan Lee
Person 2: Ryan Lansdon

This game starts by creating a 3x3 2D vector filled with zeroes. The game takes as a command line input the row and column of each player's turn, then outputs that turn as either a 1 or 2 on the board. Players must input 0-2 for the row and column, or the game will break. The game runs for nine turns, and assumes players play fair. Run the game from the command line.
